			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you can keep your head when all about you&lt;br&gt;
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,&lt;br&gt;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,&lt;br&gt;
But make allowance for their doubting too;&lt;br&gt;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,&lt;br&gt;
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,&lt;br&gt;
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,&lt;br&gt;
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;  &lt;br&gt;
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;&lt;br&gt;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster&lt;br&gt;
And treat those two impostors just the same;&lt;br&gt;
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken&lt;br&gt;
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,&lt;br&gt;
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,&lt;br&gt;
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can make one heap of all your winnings&lt;br&gt;
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,&lt;br&gt;
And lose, and start again at your beginnings&lt;br&gt;
And never breathe a word about your loss;&lt;br&gt;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew&lt;br&gt;
To serve your turn long after they are gone,&lt;br&gt;
And so hold on when there is nothing in you&lt;br&gt;
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  &lt;br&gt;
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,&lt;br&gt;
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,&lt;br&gt;
If all men count with you, but none too much;&lt;br&gt;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute&lt;br&gt;
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,  &lt;br&gt;
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,  &lt;br&gt;
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!&lt;/p&gt;
