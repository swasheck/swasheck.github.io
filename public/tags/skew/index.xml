      <description>Previously, we looked at analyzing a table to see which columns in that table may contain skewed data.
That was a good start, but now it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at the statistics that exist on that column to see if we can identify potential candidates for filtered statistics, based on the &amp;ldquo;windows&amp;rdquo; between histogram steps.
Much of the logic is the same in this script, except it counts every value in the column.</description>

      <description>While in the process of looking for a job that led to the position that I currently hold, I interviewed for a job at a recognizably-named company that was struggling to keep up with their &amp;ldquo;statistics.&amp;rdquo; I have a confession. I had no idea what &amp;ldquo;statistics&amp;rdquo; were in the SQL Server world. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t offered that job, but in the interim I did a lot of reading and research on the SQL Server notion of &amp;ldquo;statistics.</description>
