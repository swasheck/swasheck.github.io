<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure myself out &hellip; and <a href="http://swasheck.github.io/posts/tsql-tuesday-dealers-choice/" target="_blank">I&rsquo;m still a mess</a>, but that leads me to the notion of gifts. There&rsquo;s a common thread in most of these posts - they&rsquo;re not material &ldquo;things&rdquo; and tend to find their location on family, friends, and community. It&rsquo;s encouraging to hear the reverberations of the human spirit throughout the community. I&rsquo;d originally wanted to post something about family &hellip; to post something about those people who are closest to me. As I thought about it, though, I&rsquo;ve been given some tremendous gifts this year that sit somewhere in that intersection &ldquo;things&rdquo; and &ldquo;people&rdquo; - maybe they&rsquo;re &ldquo;experiences&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was a tough year, and I&rsquo;m going to start with last year at this time: 365 days ago.</p>
<ul>
<li>364 days ago <em>today</em>, my son had a conversation with a close acquaintance (but not quite friend) who made some extreme comments. It was fairly common for this boy to make extreme comments and exhibit extreme behavior. Upon reflection, this time was different. Relationships were challenged. My son didn&rsquo;t know what to do except attempt to keep the peace between this boy and his best friend. The boy went to football practice.</li>
<li>363 days ago my son&rsquo;s school was informed that this boy had died. There are still no solid details, but it&rsquo;s widely speculated that this was not an accident. The dynamic tension of life is that this is the same day that my family drove 2 hours to Ft. Collins, CO to have a US court officially declare that my (now) 3 year-old was officially recognized as ours in the eyes of the United States Courts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The gifts here are that I have been given a son who cares deeply about people around him. He cares about harmony and peace. He cares about justice. And now he cares about honoring others and their memories.</p>
<p>This past year I&rsquo;d taken a new job. After the initial honeymoon stage, it was quickly apparent that it wasn&rsquo;t a good fit for either of us. However, there were things that inhibited me from being able to move on. Because of this, I was always sad or angry. A few gifts helped me along the way &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>March 30, 2019: I went to a Switchfoot concert. They&rsquo;re my favorite band. Their music summarizes my worldview quite well, yet they possess something that I needed the most at the time - songs of hope. No matter how crummy things get, there&rsquo;s still a big beautiful world out there with amazing, beautiful people. Life is short, I want to live it well.</li>
<li>May 7, 2019: A gunman opens fire in the STEM school in Highlands Ranch, CO &hellip; .65 miles from my own kids' school &hellip; across the street from the rec center where I work out. I refuse to say that the gift was that this was not at my kids' school because that trivializes the experience of the STEM families. Instead, I got to see a community rally around each other. The church where the Jeep procession was held, before Kendrick&rsquo;s funeral is where I go to practice soccer with my oldest son. This was my community and, to be honest, I&rsquo;d mocked it for too long. This day, and the weeks following, gave me the gift of loving my community again.</li>
<li>August, 2019: My wife, sensing that I was back in a desperate place, presented me with a book she&rsquo;d bought and completed for me. One of my most basic needs is to be seen &hellip; to be known. I&rsquo;m deeply insecure and to be known and loved and &ldquo;seen&rdquo; at this level is life-giving. <img src="/images/IMG_0083.jpg" height="160" width="160" /></li>
<li>Sept 2, 2019: What luck! I got to go see Switchfoot again! This time, with my daughter. She is a lover of music and has never been to a concert in her life. Switchfoot was her first. It was a true gift to share this with her, even though she had no idea what to expect.</li>
<li>October, 2019: I started and finished <a href="" target="_blank">I&rsquo;ll Push You</a>. Yes, it&rsquo;s written by two Christian guys, and I don&rsquo;t know how you feel about that. It&rsquo;s not preachy, and it&rsquo;s a gift to me to see that friends can be amazing. I don&rsquo;t feel like I have friends - but I want to be a friend like these guys are to each other.</li>
<li>Nov 14, 2019: This is my birthday. I resigned from the bad fit job. I accepted a position with Infor Global. My daughter (a budding cross-country star) gifted me the experience of a 5k with her (on December 15th). My oldest son gifted me with tickets to opening night to see the conclusion of the Skywalker saga. And my wife? She gifted me with her unconditional love and acceptance. The ability to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to a new position that we hope will bring me greater mental health and joy.</li>
</ul>
<p>My hope is that you all find gifts in your daily lives.</p>
<blockquote><q>I've got one life<br />
and one love<br />
I've got one voice,<br /> 
maybe that's enough.<br /> 
With one heartbeat,<br /> 
two hands to give,<br /> 
I've got one shot<br /> 
One life to live.</q></blockquote>
