            <p>This sure has taken me a while to produce. I&rsquo;ve been working on it for about a month now. However, I went to the 2013 PASS Summit and have been trying to work through implementing many of the things that I learned there in our environment. Just about the time I got a handle on that, I went on call and the rest has been a blur. Also, sorry the screencaps are so small. I&rsquo;ll do better next time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m really starting to enjoy Extended Events! In our environment, we have a few large databases for which we’ve been trying to figure out how to improve the speed of our backups.</p>
<p>The Event Session (straight from <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/jonathan/an-xevent-a-day-17-of-31-a-look-at-backup-internals-and-how-to-track-backup-and-restore-throughput-part-1/">Jonathan Kehayias</a>):

Start the session, backup the database, stop the session. As you can see, I ran this 10 times (our internal policy is to allow a maximum of 10 stripes per database). Just to be sure I didn’t get any overlap (and to spare me the work of only reading timestamped event files), I would read the event file into a table (in tempdb) and then delete the event files before I reran the process.

Of course, I’m sending this backup to a NUL device which is essentially a virtual file that where the information contained within it is <a href="http://sqlinthewild.co.za/index.php/2009/08/31/backing-up-to-nul-vs-backup-with-truncate-only/">discarded</a> so I&rsquo;m really only testing maximum theoretical backup speed since there&rsquo;s
negligible write overhead associated with this. That&rsquo;s OK for the sake of this experiment because what I really wanted to test was if I could see if I could get a sense
of how the events fired when a backup is striped across multiple files.</p>
<p>Once I had my collection of temp tables, I aggregated them into another table
[code language=&ldquo;sql&rdquo;]
SELECT *
INTO [Analysis].[dbo].[BackupAnalysis]
FROM (</p>
<p>SELECT
1 AS NumberOfStripes,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY [timestamp], event_sequence) AS RowID,
*
FROM tempdb.dbo.SingleStripe
UNION ALL
SELECT
2 AS NumberOfStripes,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY [timestamp], event_sequence) AS RowID,
*
FROM tempdb.dbo.DoubleStripe
UNION ALL
SELECT
3 AS NumberOfStripes,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY [timestamp], event_sequence) AS RowID,
*
FROM tempdb.dbo.TripleStripe
UNION ALL
SELECT
4 AS NumberOfStripes,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY [timestamp], event_sequence) AS RowID,
*
FROM tempdb.dbo.QuadStripe
UNION ALL
&hellip; &ndash;at five stripes I transitioned to {Number}Stripe
SELECT
10 AS NumberOfStripes,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY [timestamp], event_sequence) AS RowID,
*
FROM tempdb.dbo.TenStripe
) ba
[/code]
Now it&rsquo;s time to start sanity-checking the data to see if what I&rsquo;ve got is even usable.
[code language=&ldquo;sql&rdquo;]
SELECT NumberOfStripes, SUM(increment)
FROM dbo.BackupAnalysis
GROUP BY NumberOfStripes
ORDER BY NumberOfStripes
[/code]
<a href="http://swasheck.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/aggregates.png"><img src="http://swasheck.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/aggregates.png" alt="aggregates"></a>
The throughput numbers are similar so we can reasonably assume that the amount of data being passed through to its &ldquo;final destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My &ldquo;control&rdquo; will be a backup with a single stripe, so I query my analysis table 
[code language=&ldquo;sql&rdquo;]
SELECT event_name, timestamp, trace_print, increment, activity_id, activity_id_xfer, event_sequence
FROM dbo.BackupAnalysis
WHERE NumberOfStripes = 1
AND (trace_print IS NOT NULL OR increment IS NOT NULL)
ORDER BY timestamp 
[/code]
<a href="http://swasheck.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/single_throughput.png"><img src="http://swasheck.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/single_throughput.png?w=300" alt="single_throughput"></a>
I&rsquo;m filtering out the data that I don&rsquo;t want (for now) and just getting the trace outputs (so that I know where to begin looking) and the increments from the throughput event. The key piece of information for which I am searching is how many activity_ids are spawned during this actual period of time. We see a 4026 throughput events which are mostly incrementing at 1048576 bytes (1MB). There are some that are smaller but for the scope of this task, the significant information is that the entirety of the backup process is done by the same activity_id 2E3D71EB-BBDF-4725-9DFA-318CBC16CECE (interestingly, the file headers are written by a different activity, 2E3D71EB-BBDF-4725-9DFA-318CBC16CECE).</p>
<p>Why is this significant? The point of this exercise was to determine if I could separate the throughput of each stripe to see if I can isolate a potential backup bottleneck on my striped backups. Let&rsquo;s look at the backup with two stripes:</p>
<p>[code language=&ldquo;sql&rdquo;]
SELECT event_name, timestamp, trace_print, increment, activity_id, activity_id_xfer, event_sequence
FROM dbo.BackupAnalysis
WHERE NumberOfStripes = 2
AND (trace_print IS NOT NULL OR increment IS NOT NULL)
ORDER BY timestamp
[/code]
<a href="http://swasheck.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/throughput.png"><img src="http://swasheck.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/throughput.png?w=300" alt="throughput"></a>
In the same section I now have two distinct activity_ids. Just for fun let&rsquo;s check the 10-stripe backup.</p>
<p>[code language=&ldquo;sql&rdquo;]
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT activity_id )
FROM (
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn, event_name, timestamp, trace_print, increment, activity_id, activity_id_xfer, event_sequence
FROM dbo.BackupAnalysis
WHERE NumberOfStripes = 10
AND (trace_print IS NOT NULL OR increment IS NOT NULL)
&ndash;ORDER BY timestamp
) j
WHERE rn BETWEEN
314 AND 4361
[/code]
<a href="http://swasheck.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/upper.png"><img src="http://swasheck.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/upper.png?w=300" alt="upper"></a>
I ran the inner query to get my boundaries which I want to be the beginning and end of the large throughput that reflect the main backup activity. You see the first occurrence at row number 314 and the last occurrence at 4361. 
<a href="http://swasheck.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/lower.png"><img src="http://swasheck.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/lower.png?w=300" alt="lower"></a>
Row 4351 is an important trace_print event because it is a new activity_id. Running this query gives me a count of 11. So row 4351 is important because it added that additional activity_id. So with a backup that is striped across 10 files, we have 10 distinct, simultaneous activities writing to each stripe.</p>
<p>So there we have it, each stripe gets its own <code>activity_id</code>. This information will be helpful as I attempt to see which stripe is getting bogged down in our backup process.</p>
