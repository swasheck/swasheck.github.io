<p>every now and then i get motivated to type a lot of words that likely make no sense. it&rsquo;s usually an interesting t-sql tuesday topic, and today is no exception. thank you to andy yun (<a href="https://sqlbek.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">b</a>|<a href="twitter.com/sqlbek/" target="_blank">t</a>) for the inspiration. this one&rsquo;s short because i dont have the emotional capacity to write a ton, but it&rsquo;s something that i need to get out.</p>
<p>i had a lot of preconceived notions about parenting. i thought less of parents whose kids made poor choices. the kid screaming on the airplane was the sign of an unprepared (at best), or emotionally abusive (at worst), or some shade of gray in between, parent. i honestly thought that, for sure, with the right amount of love, communication skills, and the undying commitment to stay married through thick and thin, that we would set up our kids for success and healthiness in their lives. that they would see us as parents who cared. as people they could trust &hellip; who sacrifice nearly everything for their good. essentially, i lost sight of nature and counted on the sheer force of will of my, no <em>our</em>, nurture.</p>
<p>now, as a parent of biological, teenage offspring, and an adopted five year-old, i&rsquo;ve come to realize how much of a factor nature truly is. kids making poor choices? that&rsquo;s a right-of-passage. or maybe it&rsquo;s a brain chemistry situation that lends itself to a proclivity to depression or anxiety. kid screaming on the plane? maybe the parents are just gutting it out with their kid who&rsquo;s on the autism spectrum and they&rsquo;re heading on a much-needed family vacation to get some relief. or perhaps they&rsquo;re en route to a healthcare provider that specializes in a treatment that they need.</p>
<p>the thing is, you never really know how what&rsquo;s going on with kids will manifest itself, nature, nurture, or something else.</p>
<p>to all the parents i&rsquo;ve judged in my mind, or under my breath. i&rsquo;m sorry. you were unknowing victims of my own preconceived notions.</p>
