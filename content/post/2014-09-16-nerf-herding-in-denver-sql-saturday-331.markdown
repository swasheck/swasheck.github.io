In the Star Wars universe, the nerf was an adaptable, hairy, slow, grumpy animal that was important for its meat. In SQL Server, the Statistic is a flexible, hairy, (sometimes) slow, grumpy blob that is important in query compilation. The similarities don't end there, though. Both nerfs and statistics can get unwieldy if not managed properly.

I have the privilege of speaking at [SQL Saturday #331](http://sqlsaturday.com/331/eventhome.aspx) in Denver this upcoming weekend (Saturday, September 20, 2014) about managing statistics in SQL Server. This topic was a major focus in our largest production environments and has yielded much of what I will be presenting in this session.

[Here is a link](https://app.box.com/s/3dz7a8n19go8n5t8zhak) to my files and below is an outline of what will be covered in this session:



	
  * back-of-the napkin statistics overview

	
  * the cost of bad statistics

	
    * underestimates

	
    * overestimates




	
  * managing statistics

	
    * naming

	
    * monitoring modifications

	
    * trace flag 2371

	
    * skew analysis

	
    * incremental statistics




	
  * observing and validating changes


There are going to be a lot of excellent speakers at this event so you're not going to be disappointed, regardless of the session(s) you choose. I look forward to seeing you there. I'll be the half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
